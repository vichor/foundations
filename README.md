# FNDTS - foundations
Basic foundations library. Old code which was wandering on my computer and decided to upload to github.
Contains
  - os abstraction module (only thread available)
  - logging module
  - message passing module

This was discontinued years ago, and other alike libraries are available. Use them instead. 
I have uploaded this just because of romantic reasons.
